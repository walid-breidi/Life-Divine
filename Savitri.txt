Sri Aurobindo Book II / Canto VIII
Only by suffering life grew colourful
It needed the spice of pain , the salt of tears.
If one could cease to be, all will be well;
Else only fierce sensations gave some zest;
A fury of jealousy burning the gnawed heart,
The sting of murderous spite and hate and lust,
The whisper that lures to the pit and 
The Mother
Only those years that has passed uselessly make you grow old.
A year spent uselessly is a year during which no progress has been accomplished,
no growth in consciousness has been achieved, no further step has been taken towards perfection.
Consecrate your life to the realisation of something higher and broader than yourself
and you will never feel the weight of the passing years.
SAVITRI
Around him shone a felicitous Day,
A luster of some raptourous Infinite,
It held in the splendour of its Golden laugh,
Regions of the heart's hapiness set free,
Drunk with God's wine,
Immersed in light, perpetually divine.
